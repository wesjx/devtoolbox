> A public toolbox for developers, built with love by [Wesley Silva](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wesley-junio/)

## 📌 About the project

**DevToolbox** was born from a personal problem: I kept discovering useful tools on social media or using them in my work/study routines, but I had no centralized place to save and organize them.

Then I thought — *what if I created a public toolbox that could help other developers too?*  
That’s how **DevToolbox** was born.
